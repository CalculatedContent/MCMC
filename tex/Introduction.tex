\para{Restricted Boltzmann Machine}
A Restricted Bolztmann Machine (RBM)\cite{mcclelland1987parallel} is a significant work bringing hypothesis in statistical physics to computer science. By stacking several layers of RBM, we will get a fundamental model, Deep Belief Network\cite{hinton2006reducing}, in the field of Deep Learning, which is nowadays the hottest class of algorithms used in Machine Learning.

\para{Estimating Partition functions} 
In the process of training an RBM, however, will include incontractable computation of the partition function.
In this paper, we implement three prevalent methods of estimating a partition function, Thouless-Anderson-Palmer Sampling(TAP)\cite{gabrie2015training}, Annealed Importance Sampling(AIS)\cite{neal2001annealed,salakhutdinov2009learning}, Rao-Blackwellized Tempered Sampling(RTS)\cite{carlson2016partition}, respectively, and give an overall comparison on the theory \& performance between them.
