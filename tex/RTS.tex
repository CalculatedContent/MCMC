\subsubsection{Rao-Blackwellized Tempered Sampling\protect\footnote{Available at \protect\url{https://github.com/lzhbrian/MCMC/blob/master/rbm/RTS.m} in Matlab}}

Similar to AIS, Rao-Blackwellized Tempered(RTS)\cite{carlson2016partition} Sampling also has a set of inverse temperatures $\{0= \beta_{1} < \beta_{2} < ... < \beta_{K} =1\}$, which can define a sequence of
\begin{equation}
f_{k}(\mathbf x) \propto f(\mathbf x)^{\beta_{k}} p_{1}(\mathbf x)^{1-\beta_{k}}
\end{equation}




The pseudo code of this algorithm is shown below:
