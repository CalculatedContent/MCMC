% the study of video access behavior

\para{Video Access Behavior.}These works usually focus on one single system, and their analysis is also limited to a specific context. In contrast, our work collects a dataset of video viewing behaviors across six major video providers with contexts such as VoD, IPTV, live streaming. This allows us to understand user migratory patterns across content providers. \cite{roberts1997weak} analyze the influence of video stream quality on user behavior from multiple CPs using quasi-experimental designs, but they do not have an in-depth study of characterizing migration behaviors.  \cite{metropolis1953equation}\cite{hastings1970monte}
