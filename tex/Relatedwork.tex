\section{Related Work} \label{sec:relatedwork}

In this paper, we do not dig very deep into a specific field of the algorithms, but provide an overall view of the MCMC method.
There are brilliant seniors who have done many marvellous works in different specific field.

\para{Complexity}
Hubbard\cite{hubbard1959calculation} is probably the earliest reseacher managing to reduce the complexity of a partition function. Beskos et al.\cite{beskos2009} made a great work in analysing the complexity of the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm. Gilks\cite{gilks2005markov} did a significant job in introducing and expanation of the MCMC method.

\para{Theoretical Explanation}
Chib et al.\cite{chib1995} gave an clear introduction and deeper explanation to the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm. Jarzynski\cite{nonequilibrium} systemetically analyzed the bias between the estimation and the real value of the partition functions in an sampling method.
