\subsubsection{Other method}
There are many other methods which can also estimate the partition functions. Such as Self-adjusted mixture sampling(SAMS)\cite{tan2015optimally} proposed a method to estimate multiple partition functions together to improve the efficiency. As the length \& time limit, we only implement 3 methods here in this paper.
